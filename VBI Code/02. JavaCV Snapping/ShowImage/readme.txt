There is 1 JPG files:

     - make sure they refer to the correct locations for your

----------------------------
Before Compilation/Execution:

You need to download and install:

  * OpenCV:  I downloaded v2.4.5 for Windows with pre-compiled binaries:
             from http://opencv.org/downloads.html
             and installed it in C:\opencv

  * JavaCV:  http://code.google.com/p/javacv/
             I downloaded javacv-0.5-bin.zip
             and installed it in C:\javacv-bin


----------------------------
Compilation:

> compile *.java
    // you must have JavaCV and OpenCV installed

----------------------------
Execution:

> run ShowImage <image file>
e.g.
> run ShowImage airplane.jpg
      -- press a key inside the window to make the application exit
