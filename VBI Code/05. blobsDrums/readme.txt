============================

There are 3 subdirectories:

  * DrumPad/
      - this contains 4 MIDI synthesis examples, with no computer vision stuff

  * HSV Selector
      - a HSV configuration file generator; use this to create the two
        configuration files used in BlobsDrumming (which must be called
        redHSV.txt and blueHSV.txt)

  * BlobDrumming
      - match against two blobs, and generate drum beats in response
