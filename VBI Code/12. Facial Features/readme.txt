============================

There are two subdirectories here:

* FeatureDetect/
    - this uses OpenCV Haar cascade classifiers to find bounded boxes
      for the face, left eye, right eye, nose, and mouth for an input
      picture

* FacialRecog/
    - this use the FaceSDK API from Luxand (http://www.luxand.com/facesdk/)
      to detect 66 facial coordinates from webcam images
