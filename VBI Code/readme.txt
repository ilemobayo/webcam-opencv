Before You Start

You need to have a webcam connected to your PC.

You need Java SDK installed, version 6 or later.

Most of the examples use the following APIs:

  * OpenCV:  I downloaded v2.4.5 for Windows with pre-compiled binaries:
             from http://opencv.org/downloads.html
             and installed it in C:\opencv
             You can download the most current version.

  * JavaCV:  http://code.google.com/p/javacv/
             I downloaded javacv-0.5-bin.zip
             and installed it in C:\javacv-bin
             ** Make sure that the version of JavaCV you download
                is compatible with the OpenCV version you installed.

For more details, read the "readme.txt" file in each sub-directory.
